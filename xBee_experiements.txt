Brief log of experiments based off "The Hands-on XBEE Lab Manual" by Jon Titus

Experiment 1: communicate with an XBee over USB using X-CTU software from digi
  a. got stuck because I didn't reset baud rate to 9600 (default for xBee).  One I 
  made this change the rest of the experiment ran flawlessly

Experiment 2: Changing module configuration params
  a. using version 10EC on a model XB24
  b. if the modem has been configured for a different baud rate, you must know this
  to use the query/test button on the main page of the X-CTU window
  
Experiment 3: One-way digital input comms
  a. configured for 9600baud, XMTR MY 1234, RCVR MY 5678
  b. D0-DIO0 <3-DI> (Digital Input enabled)

Experiemnt 4: Control an LED at the RCVR
  a. The xBee module can send and receive direct I/O commands from its DIO pins.  By
  configuring the XMTR DI0 to input and then tying the pin low/high it will txmit
  this state to teh RCVR.  The RCVR D0 is set to HIGH by default, but will signal 0
  when it rcvs that signal from teh XMTR.
  b. Also the RCVR IA setting controls which addresses can send I/O commands.  This
  experiment sets the value to FFFF.
    1) by changing the value to 3456 (a non-existant transmitter in the network) the
    two xBees still exchanged data, but 1234's I/O commands were no longer acted on.
    2) by sending +++ ATIA1234 the RCVR was configured to listen to I/O commands 
    ONLY from 1234.
    
Experiment 5: Send an anolog signal to the RCVR
  a. configure D0 for ADC at the XMTR and send the analog voltage into D0
  b. configure PWM0 for PWM.
  c. The PWM output reflects the input level.  Use a low pass filter if actual analog
  is needed at the output.  
  d. NOTE: the PWM0 or PWM1 can also be set to Rcvd Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)
  and output a PWM signal proportional to signal strength.
